## 🛠 How it works
This program emulates standard hardware inputs (**Move Forward + Sprint + Mouse Look**). 
It does not inject code into GTA V or modify memory. By simulating a "legit" 
circular run, it allows you to complete the 5-mile requirement using the 
game's actual movement logic.

## Features
* **Precise Orbit Mode:** Smooth 360° rotation using Win32API (no jerky camera).
* **Live Telemetry:** Real-time stopwatch (ms precision) and mile counter.
* **Smart Safety:** Emergency **ESC** stop and automatic key release.
* **Clean UI:** Styled after the Epsilon Program's aesthetic.
